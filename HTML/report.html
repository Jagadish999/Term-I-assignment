			<h2>Experience of learning web development</h2>
			<p>
				Web development was always a field of my interest. It was a good experience learning the web development but the best part was learning to create new ideas for creating the website. The assignment for this module is completely new for me as my entire examination of school life is based on written examination, it showed me a how boundary less examination can take place. In my personal opinion the module speaks very less in terms of 3D animation which only includes CSS3 properties like rotateX, rotateY and rotateZ but still some advanced 3D animation are unknown to us.

			<h2>Website layout Design</h2>
			<p>
				The beginning of the assignment was really confusing as the instructions were not properly understood about restriction in absolute positioning and iframe tags. After our tutor clarified those terms I started visiting many portfolio websites but I was not satisfied with overall layouts and animation used. Then I started watching some amazing 3D animation and some famous portfolio websites and created my design and animation structure. I will be describing all the designs, fonts and animation in description of each page below.

			<h2>Designing of Home page</h2>
			<p>
				Now the most difficult part for me was in designing the home page and took most of my time because I had no idea about portfolio websites. After being inspired by the portfolio website of famous web designer Jack kjeznach I decided to keep a message of myself in left side of web page and a kind of logo in right side which is designed in CSS line 198 to 277. The navigation buttons are created as 3D buttons with multiple shadows and this concept was given by a you tuber Ryan in his video “3D Text Effect in CSS/Ryan Web Tech” which is used in CSS code line 155 to 163, 213 to 223 etc.

			<h2>Designing of Portfolio Page</h2>
			<p>
				As I am not involved in any kind of web developing projects yet, there is nothing I can show as my skill and the assignment itself says to create placeholder images which will be replaced after term 2, I just created some placeholder images creating certain transition effect on them and finished designing this page.

			<h2>Designing of Contact Page</h2>
			<p>
				The contact page contains a navigation menu as similar to every page. This page contains a form and my contact information. I have chosen simple form and a card containing my information. Animation in this page is also very similar to other pages.

			<h2>Designing CV and Report page</h2>
			<p>
				Both of this pages are pretty simple. This pages only have a navigation menu and document.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				In conclusion, working in this assignment was far more interesting than just learning the html and css in regular classes. While designing the website I learned more about html and css in implementing and well structuring codes.
