		<h1>Experience of learning web development: Report</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Web development was always a field of my interest and learning the basics of web development was a wonderful experience. The assignment for this module is completely new for me and it is my first project of designing the website. While working in this project I realized that imagining is far easy than converting the idea into code.
			</p>

			<h2>Website layout Design</h2>
			<p>
				The design of my website is very simple and every main elements on the page are seen as separated from each other. I decided to make a 3D button on navigation menu overall all pages. Other designs for overall pages are also very similar with each other and designing of each pages are described individually.

			<h2>Designing of Home page</h2>

			<p>
				Now the most difficult part for me was in designing the home page and took most of my time because I had no idea about portfolio websites. After getting idea by the portfolio website of famous web designer Jack kjeznach and some other portfolio website I decided a layout for my website.
			</p>
			<img src="../IMG/screenshot/Screenshot 6.png" class="scr-1" alt="screenshot of layout">
			<p>
				 The navigation buttons are created as 3D buttons with multiple shadows. This concept was given by a you tuber Ryan in his video “3D Text Effect in CSS/Ryan Web Tech” and with some use of his idea in code line 42 to 53, 166 to 173, 230 to 240, 282 to 292 the element looks like 3d object. This codes are not completely copied but still same idea exist here. Finally after this I decided to change some background color and some spacing and finalized my layout.

			<h2>Designing of Portfolio Page</h2>
			<p>
				As I am not involved in any kind of web developing projects yet, there is nothing I can show as my skill and the assignment itself says to create placeholder images which will be replaced after term 2, I just created some placeholder images creating certain transition effect on them and finished designing this page.
			</p>

			<h2>Designing of Contact Page</h2>
			<p>
				The contact page contains a navigation menu as similar to every page. This page contains a form and my contact information. I have chosen simple form and a card containing my information. Animation in this page is also very similar to other pages.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Designing CV and Report page</h2>
			<p>
				Both of this pages are pretty simple. This pages only have a navigation menu and document.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				In conclusion, working in this assignment was far more interesting than just learning the html and css in regular classes. While designing the website I learned more about html and css in implementing and well structuring codes.
