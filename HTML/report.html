		<h1>Experience of learning web development: Report</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Web development was always a field of my interest and learning the basics of web development was a wonderful experience. The assignment for this module is completely new for me and it is my first project of designing a website. While working on this project I realized that imagining is far easy than converting the idea into code.

			<h2>Website layout Design</h2>
			<p>
				The design of my website is very simple and every main element on the page is seen as separated from each other. I decided to make a 3D button on the navigation menu overall on all pages. Other designs for overall pages are also very similar to each other and the designs of each page are described individually.

			<h2>Designing of Home page</h2>

			<p>
				Now the most difficult part for me was in designing the home page and took most of my time because I had no idea about portfolio websites. After getting idea by the portfolio website of famous web designer Jack kjeznach and some other portfolio website I decided a layout for my website.
			</p>

			<p>
				The navigation buttons are created as 3D buttons with multiple shadows. This concept was given by a you tuber Ryan in his video “3D Text Effect in CSS/Ryan Web Tech” and with some use of his idea in code line 42 to 53, 166 to 173, 230 to 240, 282 to 292 the element looks like 3d object. Another code that I searched was making text filling transparent and giving an outline in text which is used in heading in home page as well as in text logo. In code line number 137 and 138, 143 to 153, 228 and 229 this code was used which is available on website: https://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/. This codes are not completely copied but still same idea exist here. Finally after this I decided to change some background color and some spacing and finalized my layout. The screenshot of validation of home page is also included.

			<p>Talking about the responsive view in mobile devices, it has some changes in its layout. The gaping and margins are slightly decreased and a hamburger menu appears which can be opened and closed by clicking it. Similarly, the navigation menu is also redesigned where each menu is displayed vertically after a click on hamburger menu.</p>

			<h2>Designing of Portfolio Page</h2>
			<p>
				As I am not involved in any kind of web developing projects yet, there is nothing I can show as my skill and the assignment itself says to create placeholder images which will be replaced after term 2, I just created some placeholder images creating certain transition effect on them and finalized design of page. The first design I selected was quite unsatisfying and I changed the design with simple work demonstration page. The responsive view has only two columns of project demonstration and hamburger menu. The image of validation of html is also mentioned below. The CSS file is same for all pages so I would not show them in description of every page.

			<h2>Designing of Contact Page</h2>
			<p>
				The contact page contains a navigation menu as similar to every page. This page contains a form and my contact information. I have chosen simple neon outline form and a card containing my information. Animation in this page is also very similar to other pages. The idea of form is from neon text effect which is shown in website: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-neon-text-with-css/ . The difficulty was creating shadow inside the border on input elements and I found the way on same website: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-box-shadow/ which is used in code line 497 in CSS.  This page also have some changes in mobile view all the main elements are displayed vertically and same hamburger menu functioning as other pages. On submitting the form, mail box appears as explained in assignment. This is idea was in https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_address.asp, which is used in code line 39 of html page.

			<h2>Designing CV and Report page</h2>
			<p>
				Both of this pages are pretty simple. This pages only have a navigation menu and document. Both of this pages are pretty simple. This pages only have a navigation menu and document. The CV is written following tips available on website: https://www.cvplaza.com/cv-examples/good-bad-cv/.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				In conclusion, working in this assignment was far more interesting than just learning the html and css in regular classes. The Java Script was difficult in managing hamburger menu but somehow it was managed and it became one of the best experiences.
